# example

First install all dependencies by running `yarn install`.

To run the app on iOS:

- Run `cd ios/ && pod install`
- Run `yarn react-native run-ios`, or
- Open `example/ios/Test.xcworkspace` in Xcode and hit the "Run" button

To run the app on Android:

- Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected
- `yarn react-native run-android`
- You may need to run `yarn start` (more information about this [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#troubleshooting-run))
